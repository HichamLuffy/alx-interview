# Pascal's Triangle

Pascal's Triangle is a unique arrangement of numbers that reveals various mathematical properties and finds utility in combinatorics, algebra, and probability theory. The triangle is built on a simple foundation: each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

## Understanding Pascal's Triangle

Constructing Pascal's Triangle is straightforward. Follow these enhanced steps to create your own:

### Step 1: Start with a Single Number

Begin by writing the number `1` at the top, which forms the vertex of the triangle.

```plaintext
1
```

### Step 2: Add Rows

Each new row starts and ends with a `1`. 

```plaintext
   1
  1 1
```

### Step 3: Fill in the Interior Numbers

Position each new interior number such that it is the sum of the two numbers above it.


```plaintext
   1
  1 1
 1 2 1
```


Notice that the 2 in the third row comes from adding the two 1s directly above it.

### Step 4: Continue the Pattern

Continue this pattern for as many rows as you like. Each new row will have one more number than the row above it.

```plaintext
   1
  1 1
 1 2 1
1 3 3 1
```


### Step 5: Extend the Triangle

As you extend the triangle, remember that every edge number is `1`, and each interior number is the sum of the two numbers from the row above.

```plaintext
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
```


## Properties of Pascal's Triangle


- **Symmetry**: Each row is symmetric a mirror image of itself.
- **Binomial Coefficients**: The numbers correspond to the coefficients in the binomial expansion of `(a + b)^n`.

- **Triangular Numbers**: The third diagonal from the vertex lists the triangular numbers.
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: Diagonal sums equate to the Fibonacci sequence.

## Applications


- **Combinatorics**: Pascal's Triangle provides the number of ways to choose `k` items from a set of `n`, without repetition.
- **Probability Theory**: The binomial coefficients in Pascal's Triangle correspond to the probabilities in a binomial distribution.

- **Algebra**: It can be used to find the coefficients of polynomial expansions.

## Conclusion

Pascal's Triangle is not only a fascinating mathematical concept with a simple construction process but also a powerful tool with numerous applications. By following the steps outlined above, one can easily construct and explore the depths of Pascal's Triangle.
